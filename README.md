# DataScience Project

## Problem
The process of admission into courses is randomly selected. There will be a difference in the levels of students, which is a hindrance to the trainer. The reason for admission being random because there are thousands of submissions and tens of courses, so we can not check all the submissions and rate each one of them.

## Solution
Build a model that can determine the score for each submission based on the information provided by the trainees, and the score will be used to determine acceptance.

## Goals
- Automate admission process.
- Build model can nomination the best trainees.
- Build and preparing the data for the future.

## Dataset
There are not similar dataset for this project so we decided to generate new dataset with real values.
